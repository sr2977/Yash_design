        <h2 class="move-text">Introduction</h2>
        <!-- Place your introduction content here -->
        <p>Network security has become a key concern for enterprises of all sizes and types in recent years. As the volume and sophistication of cyber assaults increase, protecting against these threats becomes more difficult. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most important technologies for detecting and preventing network intrusions. These systems examine network traffic for patterns that signal the existence of malicious activity. Traditional intrusion detection systems, on the other hand, are frequently restricted in their capacity to identify innovative or previously undisclosed threats since they rely on pre-defined criteria and signatures. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a viable strategy for improve by allowing hacking detection systems to function them to learn from data and adapt to new threats in real-time.</p>

<p>
In this study, we undertake a comprehensive overview of the investigation of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems. We examine the many types of ML approaches used in this context, as well as the obstacles and constraints involved with their use. Our objective is to present a complete review of the current status of ML-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and to identify future research approaches that might assist to enhance their accuracy and reliability in the face of emerging threats.

        <h2 class="move-text">Overview/Background</h2>
        <!-- Place your introduction content here -->
        <p>Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) primarily depend on rule-based or signature-based detection approaches, which have limitations in detecting innovative threats. Machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) provide a more flexible and scalable method to intrusion detection because they can learn from enormous amounts of data and adapt to new sorts of assaults. There are three approaches to ML-based IDSs: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>
Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, entails training a model without any specified labels on unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning seeks to uncover hidden patterns and structures in data. Unsupervised learning may be used for anomaly detection in the context of intrusion detection systems, where the model learns to recognize patterns in data that differ from typical behavior. This strategy is effective when the properties of regular traffic are well understood but defining the characteristics of malicious traffic is challenging.
</p>

<p>
Reinforcement learning is a form of machine learning
method in which an agent is trained to execute behaviors in
an environment in order to maximize a reward signal. The
agent learns by trial and error, altering its behavior in response
to feedback from its surroundings. In the context of intrusion
detection systems, reinforcement learning may be used to teach
an agent to identify and mitigate intrusions. This method is
beneficial when the IDS is operating in a dynamic environment
with changing threats and attack patterns.
</p>

<p>
Each of these systems has advantages and disadvantages
and is appropriate for different sorts of intrusion detection
scenarios. The technique chosen is determined on the nature of
the data and the sort of attack that the IDS is meant to detect.
In the sections that follow, we will go through each of these
techniques in greater depth and emphasize their contributions
to the development of ML-based IDSs.

        <h2 class="move-text">Research Area 1: Machine Learning Algorithms for Intrusion Detection</h2>
        <p>There are three types of machine learning algorithms: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Improving the interpretability of machine learning models, dealing with unbalanced datasets, and dealing with adversarial assaults on IDSs are some of the primary issues in this field. Choosing adequate features and extracting useful information from raw data is also an important step in constructing successful ML-based IDSs. This study topic is critical for developing the science of intrusion detection and enhancing computer network security.</p>

Bellman equation until convergence.</li>
<li><b>Actor-Critic</b>: Actor-Critic is a reinforcement learning
algorithm used in artificial intelligence and game theory

        <h2 class="move-text">Research Area 2:  Feature Selection and
Extraction For Machine Learning-Based
Intrusion Detection Systems</h2>
        <p>Feature selection and extraction are major study areas in
ML-based IDSs. The process of picking the most relevant
features or characteristics from raw data to employ in the
ML model is referred to as feature selection and extraction.
Because the quality of features included in ML models has
a substantial influence on the accuracy of intrusion detection,
this study field is crucial for advancing the issue ahead.</p>

        <h3 class="move-text">Subtopics and Approaches:</h3>

        <h4 class="move-text">A. Feature Selection Techniques:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Wrapper methods</b>: Wrapper methods are feature selection
techniques used in machine learning and data mining
to evaluate the performance of a subset of features by
training a model on each subset and selecting the subset
in the best performance, usually by the use of a heuristic
search algorithm or an optimization method.
</li>
<li><b>Filter methods</b>: Filter methods are feature selection techniques used in machine learning and data mining to rank
features based on a statistical measure of their correlation
or independence with the target variable, and select the
top-ranked features with the highest predictive power and
the lowest redundancy, without taking into account the
performance of a specific learning algorithm.</li>
<li><b>Embedded methods</b>: Embedded methods are feature selection techniques used in machine learning and data
mining to select those features that are most pertinent
during training the model by incorporating the feature
selection process into the model construction itself, typically through the use of regularization techniques or decision tree algorithms that penalize irrelevant or redundant
features and improve the model’s.</li>
<li><b> Hybrid methods</b>: Hybrid methods are feature selection
techniques used in machine learning and data mining that
combine two or more feature selection techniques, such as
filter and wrapper methods, to leverage their complementary strengths and overcome their limitations, resulting in
improved feature selection performance, interpretability,
and scalability.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="move-text">B. Feature Extraction Techniques:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Principal Component Analysis(PCA)</b>: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widespread autonomous
machine learning approach that reduces dimensionality,
compresses data, and extracts features by finding and
choosing a smaller subset of the most relevant variables
that explain the greatest variance in the original data.
</li>
<li><b>Independent Component Analysis(ICA)</b>: Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) is a machine learning computational approach that identifies and exploits statistical
features of data to split multivariate signals into their
oneself, distinct components.

learning that finds a linear combination of features that
maximum separates the classes while reducing intraclass variation to minimize the dimensionality of a highdimensional dataset.
</li>
<li><b>Non-negative Matrix Factorization(NMF)</b>: Non-negative
Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a data analysis and unconstrained learning approach that divides a non-negative
matrix into two lower-rank matrices with non-negative
components that can be regarded as expressing latent
properties of the original data.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="move-text">C. Deep Learning-Based Feature Selection and Extraction:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)</b>: Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) are a type of deep learning
neural network that is especially well-suited for image
recognition and processing tasks due to their dealt architecture that uses convolutional neural network layers in
order to automatically learn a hierarchical set of features
from raw pixel data. These networks can detect and
categorize pictures with high accuracy by stacking many
convolutional layers and learning increasingly abstract
and sophisticated properties.</li>
<li><b>Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN)</b>: Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN) are a sort of artificial neural network in
which node connections create a directed cycle, allowing
the network to retain a state and handle sequential input
such as time series, spoken language, and audio signals.
</li>
<li><b>Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN)</b>: GANs are a
deep learning system that consists of two neural networks
- a generator network and a discriminator network - that
are trained in an adversarial situation to produce synthetic
data that mimics actual data. The generator network
creates fictitious data samples, while the discriminator
network learns to discriminate between genuine and fictitious data samples. The generator network is enhanced
through an iterative process of training and feedback
to create increasingly realistic synthetic data, while the
discriminator network is trained to better discern between
genuine and false data.</li>

        <h2 class="move-text">Conclusion</h2>
        <!-- Place your abstract content here -->
        <p>Lastly, due to the increasing number of security threats in
computer systems, Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems have become increasingly important. To boost
transparency and confidence in the models, many ML approaches like as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines,
Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks have
been applied to intrusion detection, coupled with interpretability techniques such as LIME and SHAP. However, the systems
are still vulnerable to poisoning, evasion, and Trojan attacks,
and countermeasures such as adversarial training, robust feature extraction and selection, and model ensembling must be
developed to improve the system’s robustness against attacks.</p>
